# Change Log

### 0.7.0

**Scaffolding:**

- Add mnemonic to Preferences menu in scaffolding
- Make bin/glimmer, bin/girb, and scaffolded bin/script files call jruby instead of ruby in the shebang
- Launch scaffolded app on Linux without using packaging (via `glimmer bin/app_script`)
- Add all of Mac, Windows, and Linux icons upon scaffolding (not just for the OS we are on)

**Packaging:**

- Perform gemspec:generate first during packaging
- Ensure lock_jars step happens before package:jar to have vendor jar-dependencies packaged inside JAR file
- Change lock_jar vendor-dir to vendor/jars and add it to .gitignore
- Handle naming of -Bwin.menuGroup properly for Windows in scaffolded custom shell gems (and apps) (e.g. instead of Glimmer Cs Timer set to Timer only or namespace when available in a CustomShell)
- Support passing javapackager extra args after `glimmer package:native` command inside double-quotes (e.g. `glimmer package:native "-title 'CarMaker'"`)
- JDK14 experimental `jpackage` support as a packaging alternative to `javapackager` (Not recommended for production use and must specify JDK8 as JRE with an additional option since SWT doesn't support JDK14 yet)

- Add radio and checkbox table editors
- Add `content` method to DisplayProxy
- Add `content` method to MessageBox

- Fix issue with TableProxy editor rejecting false and nil values set on items
