    Before using `glimmer` or `girb`, start a new shell session in the same directory (open a new terminal tab and go to the same directory) or run the following command:
    
    export JRUBY_OPTS="$JRUBY_OPTS -J-XstartOnFirstThread"
    
    Afterwards, you may run the following commands:
    
    glimmer
    girb
    
  OUTPUT
end
