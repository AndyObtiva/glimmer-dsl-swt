## Girb (Glimmer irb) Command

With `glimmer-dsl-swt` installed, you may want to run `girb` instead of standard `irb` to have SWT preloaded and the Glimmer library required and included for quick Glimmer coding/testing.

```
girb
```

If you cloned [glimmer-dsl-swt](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt) project locally, you may run `bin/girb` instead.

```
bin/girb
```

Watch out for hands-on examples in this README indicated by "you may copy/paste in [`girb`](#girb-glimmer-irb-command)"

Keep in mind that all samples live under [https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt/samples](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-dsl-swt/samples)

If you need a more GUI interactive option to experiment with Glimmer GUI DSL Syntax, you may try:
- [Glimmer Meta-Sample (The Sample of Samples)](#samples): allows launching Glimmer samples and viewing/editing code to learn/experiment too.
- ["Ugliest Editor Ever"](https://github.com/AndyObtiva/glimmer-cs-gladiator)
- Just build your own GUI editor using the [Glimmer DSL for SWT Ruby Gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/glimmer-dsl-swt).
